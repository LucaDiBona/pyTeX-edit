# PyLaTeXManager
Manages LaTeX files for me using python - this is intended for my very specific use case. It allows me to manage LaTeX lecture notes and homework in a variety of ways. It was originally written with my specific workflow in mind, and may need major customisation to adapt to yours, but the MIT license allows for this. This project is also continuously evolving alongside my workflow, and no features are guaranteed to be permanent.

The LaTeX templates that I use, and that this program works with, can be found in my LaTeX-templates repo.
